Color is a powerful tool in web design, capable of evoking emotions and influencing perceptions. Understanding color psychology is crucial for designers to create the desired atmosphere on a website. For instance, blue can convey trust and dependability, often used by financial institutions, while green is associated with growth and health, making it a popular choice for wellness brands. Choosing the right color palette can elevate a brand's message and connect with the target audience on a deeper level.
